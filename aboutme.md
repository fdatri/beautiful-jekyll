I'm a PhD student in Cognitive Science and Neuroscience at the University of Trieste, Life Sciences Department. My main research focus is on visual attention, but I am also interested in psychometrics, research methods, and meta-science. I completed my master at the University of Trieste with a thesis on Bidimensional Regression (also known as Procrustes analysis) applied to drawing tests.
